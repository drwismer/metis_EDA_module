# MTA Turnstile Project Proposal

### Client
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
    
### Project Deliverables
We are preparing for increased activity in our public transportation as COVID vaccinations continue to be administered. In preparation, we would like to understand which one our stations and transportation lines are being overutilized and underutilized. Please analyze turnstile data from the first five months of 2021, providing insights about our busiest and our least busy accommodations. It would also be helpful to understand how transportation usage is trending over those five months, both in total and by station/line. Furthermore, we would like to empower our customers to understand usage patterns and plan their trips accordingly. If time permits, please build an interactive tool that allows our customers to understand historically high traffic times of the day and/or week in order to assist in smoothing our usage rates throughout the day.
